# Intro

This repo shows `Mapbox GL JS` and `Bootstrap` playing nicely together.

This repo can be used as a kind of boilerplate for new `Mapbox / Bootstrap` projects.

# Beg, borrow, steal

This project borrows heavily - read steals from - this `Codepen`: [http://codepen.io/technoloG/pen/vKZNao](http://codepen.io/technoloG/pen/vKZNao)
